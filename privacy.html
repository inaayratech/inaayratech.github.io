    <div class="content-section">
      <p><strong>Last Updated: <span id="lastUpdated"></span></strong></p>

      <p>Welcome to Notch‑Tasker ("us", "we", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our application Notch‑Tasker (the "Application") and our website (collectively, the "Services"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application or services.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:</p>

        <li><strong>Application Data:</strong> If you connect your account to third-party services, we may collect information necessary to facilitate this connection. Any data stored within the Notch-Tasker application (e.g., tasks, notes) is stored locally on your device or, if you choose to use a cloud sync service (not provided by us by default), then by that third-party service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Application to:</p>

        <li>Create and manage your account.</li>
        <li>Email you regarding your account or order.</li>
        <li>Enable user-to-user communications (if applicable).</li>
        <li>Improve the Application and troubleshoot issues.</li>
        <li>Request feedback and contact you about your use of the Application.</li>

      <p>We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>By Law or to Protect Rights:</strong> If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.

        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

      <h2>4. Security of Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>
