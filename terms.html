      <h2>4. Disclaimers</h2>
      <h3>4.1 "As Is" Basis</h3>
      <p>Our applications are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>

      <h3>4.2 No Guarantee</h3>
      <p>We do not guarantee that our applications will be error-free, uninterrupted, secure, or meet your specific requirements.</p>

      <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Inaayra Tech LLC shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from your use of our applications.</p>

      <h3>7.2 Lifetime Access</h3>
      <p>"Lifetime" purchases grant you access for the operational lifetime of the application. This means:</p>

        <li>Lifetime does not guarantee perpetual availability, updates, or new features</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to discontinue the application with reasonable notice (minimum 90 days when practicable)</li>
        <li>Upon discontinuation of the application or dissolution of Inaayra Tech LLC, all obligations related to lifetime purchases cease</li>

      <h3>7.5 Feature Changes</h3>
      <p>We may modify, add, or remove features at any time. Purchases grant access to the application's functionality as it exists at any given time, not to specific features that may change.</p>
